Healthcare Data Security and Privacy
==================================

Overview
--------
This project presents a comprehensive study on healthcare data security and privacy, focusing on 
modern cyber threats, regulatory frameworks, and practical mitigation strategies in the healthcare 
industry. The work combines theoretical analysis, real-world case studies, and survey-based findings 
to highlight existing gaps and propose actionable security improvements.

The research emphasizes the growing risks to sensitive patient data due to increased digitization, 
IoT adoption, insider threats, phishing, and ransomware attacks, while also examining compliance 
requirements such as HIPAA, GDPR, and India’s DPDP Act 2023.

Objectives
----------
- Analyze current healthcare data security and privacy challenges
- Study the impact of cyberattacks and data breaches in healthcare systems
- Evaluate regulatory frameworks governing healthcare data protection
- Understand real-world practices through survey findings
- Propose practical mitigation strategies and security best practices

Key Topics Covered
------------------
- Healthcare data security fundamentals
- Data privacy and patient consent
- Phishing, ransomware, insider threats, and IoT vulnerabilities
- Regulatory compliance (HIPAA, HITECH Act, GDPR, DPDP 2023)
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Encryption and data protection strategies
- Impact analysis of healthcare data breaches
- Survey-based insights from healthcare professionals
- Case studies from the Indian healthcare sector

Methodology
-----------
- Literature review of healthcare security standards and regulations
- Analysis of recent healthcare cyber incidents and breaches
- Survey conducted among healthcare professionals to assess awareness 
  and real-world security practices
- Evaluation of emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI 
  for healthcare data protection

Findings
--------
- Low awareness of healthcare data security laws among professionals
- Lack of formal security training in many healthcare institutions
- Weak access control and credential management practices
- Inconsistent use of encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Minimal incident response preparedness in case of data breaches

Proposed Mitigations
--------------------
- Regular security awareness and training programs
- Strong encryption for data storage and transmission
- Multi-factor authentication and role-based access control
- Regular password rotation and credential management
- Dedicated IT security teams within healthcare institutions
- Periodic security audits and compliance checks
- Improved patient consent transparency and education
